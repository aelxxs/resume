### Contributing

Don't. This is my resum√©, but if you want to use it as a template for your own resum√©, feel free to fork it and make changes to your own copy.

If you find a typo or something, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Otherwise, if you have any suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always looking for ways to improve my resum√©!

### Acknowledgements

I can't remember where I got the original template from, but I've made a lot of changes to it since then.
